From global business to life-saving transportation, we’ve come to rely on flying as a safe, fast, and reliable means of movement. But today, our planet demands that it be something more: sustainable.Sustainable aviationNeste MY SAFNeste ImpactTransformation JourneyNeste x DeltaSAF FAQsAviation currently accounts for approximately 2 to 3% of global carbon emissions. Counting non-CO2 emissions, its overall contribution to climate change is significantly higher — and likely to rise as demand for air travel keeps increasing. The world needs a solution to decarbonize the aviation industry today.2-3%Aviation currently accounts for approximately 2 to 3% of global CO2 emissions.200%According to IATA projections air travel is going to double by 2040.The industry can take action nowSolving the sustainability issue is an urgent one that requires immediate solutions. This is leading organizations to think and act differently when it comes to flying, with many asking how they can support climate action and decarbonization today.Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)provides a key solution available today. It is a direct replacement for fossil jet fuel, made from renewable raw materials, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%* over the fuel’s life cycle compared to using fossil jet fuel. It is a safe and proven solution used in existing aircraft without the need for modifications.Show moreThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) has set goals for carbon-neutral growth from 2020 onwards and net-zero carbon emissions from aviation by 2050. In order to achieve this, IATA estimates thatSustainable Aviation Fuelcan deliver approximately 65% of the emission reduction required to get to net zero, leading numerous airlines and other aviation stakeholders to start using SAF, and in many cases, to set specific targets for SAF use. Adoption of SAF is also increasingly being driven by supporting policies such as mandates, as governments seek to take meaningful action on climate change now.Neste MY Sustainable Aviation FuelReduce emissions from flying with sustainable aviation fuelNeste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ is a today solution to decarbonize the aviation industry, commercially available and in use worldwideGo to Neste MY SAF product pageNeste ImpactThe easy way to reach your sustainability targetsNeste Impact is the emission reduction solution for companies ready to take action, today.

    "content": "Products and Innovation…DHL and Neste: case storyAviation5 minute readDHL and Neste join forces to decarbonize logisticsRenewable fuels play a major role in DHL’s decarbonization roadmap, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050.FacebookLinkedIn𝕏In this article:DHL and Neste are partnering to decarbonize logistics, with renewable fuels playing a crucial role in DHL's plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050DHL considers SAF a key solution for reducing its aviation carbon footprint, due to its compatibility with existing aircraft and infrastructureDHL emphasizes that there is a growing demand for more sustainable solutions from customersThe logistics industry could be described as the backbone of our global economy and supply chains – the wheels that keep the economy running. “Life today wouldn’t work without international logistics and shipping. Logistics is very important for international trade, connecting people and improving lives,” saysMarkus Otto, SVP Aviation, DHL Express Europe. The DHL Group is one of the largest logistics companies in the world. DHL Express is operating around 2,400 daily flights with 300 dedicated freighter aircrafts, and delivering packages with more than 34,000 courier vehicles.However, the logistics sector also remains very dependent on fossil fuels and is therefore in need of a major shift towards more sustainable means of transporting goods – by switching, for example, torenewable fuels. In this sense, DHL can be considered a frontrunner, having started decarbonizing its services over a decade ago. When it comes to air freight, already 3.6 percent of jet fuel used in DHL’s aviation operations is neatsustainable aviation fuel (SAF).“The first and most obvious way to improve our carbon footprint is to be as fuel-efficient as possible, so we are optimizing, for example, the aircraft types we use on certain routes. The second way is to decide what you burn. You can burn kerosene-based fossil fuel or fuel blends including SAF,” saysAndreas Mündel, SVP Strategy & Operations Programs, DHL Group.This content could not be shownWe would like to show you a video here, but could not because of your cookie configuration.

Here SAF as a drop-in fuel that can be used in its existing fleet is seen as the main solution for emission reductions. “The beauty of SAF is that we can drop it into the fuel tank and use it as is with existing aircraft, fuel tankers, and our current fuel infrastructure,” Otto says.In the baseline year 2021, the DHL Group emitted 40 million metric tons of CO2, including suppliers and subcontractors, and has set a target to reduce it to 29 million metric tons by the year 2030. The company aims to be green house gas (GHG) net zero by 2050.Mündel adds that lower-GHG-emission logistics solutions have become increasingly important for customers, as logistics often account for a major part of their customers’scope 3 emissions.\"The beauty of SAF is that we can drop it into the fuel tank and use it as is with existing aircraft, fuel tankers, and our current fuel infrastructure.\"Markus Otto, SVP Aviation, DHL Express EuropeA strategic partnership for scalable sustainabilityNeste originally delivered the first batches of SAF to DHL in 2020, as one of the company’s first strategic suppliers. Mündel says that partnering with a frontrunner such as Neste was important for demonstrating the availability of SAF on a global level.“I believe DHL can act as a change agent for the logistics and transport sectors with its ‘let’s do it’ attitude, showing that we can accelerate the decarbonization of the industry,”Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste says and emphasizes how SAF and renewable diesel – as drop-in solutions – are available at scale already today for making immediate emissions reductions.“SAF will play an important role in decarbonizing aviation, and its significance will grow over the coming years as we see further regulation supporting its scale-up. Obviously, the industry needs to further ramp up production, and that requires strong commitment from companies and support from governments to make the required major investments. Regulation, for example, can play an important role in closing the cost gap between renewable and fossil fuels,” Nyberg points out.Book and claim: Tracking emissions reduction in a global networkDiscussing the transformation of the entire industry, Mündel highlights the crucial role of abook and claimsystem, i.e. a tool that helps companies more easily reduce their carbon emissions.

While there are inherent risks in any development or operation, we aim to avoid them, reduce them to acceptable levels, or remedy the impacts.We use core processes and internal frameworks to manage our operations. OurOperations Integrity Management System (OIMS), for example, and its integrated risk management system, helps us to identify, assess, manage, and monitor environmental and socioeconomic impacts, risks and opportunities throughout the life cycles of our assets.We use ourEnvironmental Aspects Guideto identify and assess significant environmental and socioeconomic aspects, in line with ourEnvironment Policy. Environmental aspects include activities, products, or services that can interact with the environment. This also covers the “human environment,” which includes social and economic aspects beyond just climate and nature.Our processes include:Environmental Aspects Assessment.Environmental, Socioeconomic, and Health Impact Assessment.Environmental, Socioeconomic, and Health Management Plans.We engage with local communities and stakeholders to understand the local socioeconomic setting, incorporate feedback, data, and other due diligence information into these processes. We periodically update our assessments and plans to reflect changes in operational complexity or socioeconomic sensitivities. When needed, we adjust our management plans accordingly.For example, at the PNG LNG project in Papua New Guinea, operated by ExxonMobil PNG Limited, the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) guides our work. It helps us manage and reduce environmental, social, community health, safety, and security impacts. The ESMP also ensures we meet Papua New Guinea’s legislative and regulatory requirements. This involves complying with more than 1,300 regulatory obligations and more than 2,700 licenses, permits, certificates, and associated conditions.The ESMP was developed after extensive consultation with stakeholders. It includes environmental and social management and mitigation measures, monitoring requirements established by thePNG LNG Environmental Impact Statement, and lessons learned from the project’s construction phase. It also incorporates OIMS, the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards, and other international standards such as the Equator Principles.The ESMP consists of three environmental management and seven social management plans covering all PNG LNG facilities. Requirements of the Production ESMP apply during normal operating conditions, as well as in reasonably foreseeable abnormal operating conditions or emergency situations.

    "content": "13/06/2025 • 8 mins readThe Spirit of Gresik: Reviving Natural Ecosystems and Empowering Local CommunitiesFacebookWhatsappTwitterNestled in the heart of Gresik, East Java, Indonesia, lies a vibrant and resilient community rich in culture, history, and determination. Here, every thread of tradition and every root in the soil tells a story of perseverance and interconnectedness. These stories come to life through the initiatives of PETRONAS Indonesia, whose commitment to social impact and environmental stewardship is making significant strides in community empowerment and environmental conservation through its social impact initiatives. These efforts, encapsulated in the Planting Tomorrow initiative and the Uplifting Lives initiative, are transforming lives and landscapes, fostering sustainable development and cultural preservation.Through their Planting Tomorrow and Uplifting Lives initiatives, PETRONAS is more than a catalyst for change; it is a partner to the people, empowering communities to thrive while nurturing the natural world. By uniting tradition and conservation, these programmes offer a glimpse into the powerful partnership between people and planet. Two extraordinary efforts stand out in this mission: the revitalisation of Batik culture and the restoration of mangrove ecosystems. These initiatives, deeply connected, not only preserve the soul of Gresik but also secure its future.An artisan skillfully applies batik wax on fabric, creating intricate floral designs. This traditional technique plays a significant role in preserving local culture in Gresik, Indonesia. Photo taken at the Manyarsidorukun village, Gresik.Empowering Women and Preserving Heritage Through BatikBatikis more than fabric; it is a vibrant canvas that captures the heartbeat of a community. Through the Uplifting Lives initiative there are collaborations with artisans in Manyarsidorukun village to breathe new life into this age-old tradition. The beautiful pattern ofBatik Damar Rukunis more than just fabric; it is the village's soul. Each stroke tells a story ofgotong-royong(synergy), and the prints reflect the signature commodities of Gresik. TheBatik Damar Rukunprogramme, led by the dedicated Ibu Masturoh and her team of women, is creating far-reaching impact. These women, mostly housewives, learned to design and produceBatikadorned with motifs that reflect the identity of Gresik, such as milkfish and mangroves. These motifs are iconic symbols of the region and weaves tales of gratitude, synergy and harmony into every piece.Together with PETRONAS, the artisans receive training, equipment, and ongoing mentoring to refine their craft and bring their products to market, instilling a sense of purpose and independence among the artisans. TheirBatikis not only sold locally but also reaches bustling urban centres like Jakarta, showcasing the artistry of Gresik on a national stage. This achievement is more than economic success; it embodies cultural pride and recognition. These fabrics carry the stories of a village, woven into every intricate pattern.With every brush of wax and colour, these women work with care and precision, breathing life into their art, documenting their journeys, values and cultural heritage. Each piece ofBatikis a tangible manifestation of their resilience, creativity, connectedness and shared vision for a brighter future.For the women, theBatik Damar Rukunprogramme symbolises opportunity. It brings financial independence to their families while positioning them as cultural ambassadors. PETRONAS’ involvement extends beyond skill-building; their support bridges tradition with modern commerce, ensuring this heritage carries on for future generations.Mangroves as Guardians of LifeNot far from the busy hands ofBatikartisans, another story of hope is unfolding in Manyarsidomukti village, located 10 kilometres to the south within the same district. Under the Planting Tomorrow initiative, PETRONAS has embarked on an ambitious mission to restore mangrove ecosystems that are vital to coastal resilience and biodiversity. The ecological importance of mangroves lies in their ability to prevent coastal erosion, support marine life, and store carbon—but for the people of Gresik, these trees are also lifelines for livelihoods.A Day Among the MangrovesThe work to restore mangroves is not without its challenges. Each day begins before sunrise, as villagers gather their tools and set out for the coast. Waist submerged in deep mud and water, volunteers carefully sort saplings, tie their fragile roots, and meticulously place them in baskets for safe planting. This process is an act of patience and precision, each sapling symbolising hope for the future.Amid the volunteers is an inspiring figure, Pak Khotib, who has dedicated his life to mangrove conservation. For his family, this mission is not merely about planting trees; it is about nurturing a legacy. Decades of conservation work have allowed them to pass on knowledge, dedicatio",

The sun blazes down, casting long shadows over the asphalt. The air is electric with the roar of engines and the exhilarated cheers of the crowd, with anticipation buzzing as the race is about to begin.Amidst this symphony of speed and excitement, two young men in crisp white shirts adorned with a myriad of logos navigate the bustling garage with practiced ease. Large headphones hug their heads, blocking out the cacophony as they carefully carry a few bottles containing fluid samples from the winning cars. They head to the trackside laboratory in one corner of the garage, where their work matters most.In the fast-paced world of Formula One where split milliseconds define success, the role of trackside engineers has never been more crucial. Among these unsung heroes are Wan Mohd Saifullah Wan Saudi and Emil Bernsten, two PETRONAS Trackside Fluid Engineers (PTFE), whose journey from diverse backgrounds to the most prestigious motorsport track exemplifies the spirit of collaboration, innovation, and excellence.Two young Malaysians, the unsung heroes of Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One TeamPETRONAS and the Mercedes-AMG Formula One (F1) Team's partnership has been truly transformative. PETRONAS has not only served as the team's Title and Technical Partner but has also played a pivotal role in developing cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions. The successful history of this partnership is evidenced by the integration of PETRONAS Fluid Technology Solutions™️ with Mercedes-Benz's Formula One engine, a collaboration that has fortified the team with eight world championships since 2010.The Fundamental Role of Trackside Fluid EngineersSaifullah, with a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, accumulated a decade of invaluable experience as an Instrument and Control Engineer in Miri and Bintulu, Sarawak. In this role, he was passionate about a software programme he developed from scratch, incorporating vast amounts of data to enhance his team's efficiency. He also brought with him an affinity for entrepreneurship from college, along with early work experience in telecommunications, to motorsport in May 2023. Given his background and experience, Saifullah’s journey is fueled by his passion for data science and its capacity to drive significant transformations in the field of Formula One.On the other hand, Emil, a Chemical Engineering graduate, served as a Global Approval Specialist when he first joined PLI in Turin, Italy, in 2020. He was responsible for ensuring PETRONAS fluids are compliant with regulatory standards and requirements for different countries. His fascination with energy solutions and renewables during high school eventually led him to the world of motorsport. Although it may seem unrelated, the world of motorsport is deeply connected to high-performance technology, and with Formula 1's recent shift towards sustainable fuel, it is now closely tied to renewable energy solutions. Emil is grateful that his fascination led him to the right place.Since May 2022, Emil has been an integral part of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 team, leveraging every visit to the paddock as an opportunity for growth. His experiences from attending many races now have honed his instincts, expanded his technical knowledge, and deepened his understanding of the intricacies of Formula 1. He recalls underestimating the timeline for maintenance and equipment delivery during one of his first races, but the team’s growth mindset and refusal to play the blame game empowered him and taught him valuable lessons in resilience and overcoming setbacks.Saifullah added that being immersed in a totally different culture and work environment has been enlightening. He appreciates the experience and hopes to apply the positive aspects of the team’s growth mindset, accountability, and resilience to enrich his journey at PETRONAS.As PETRONAS Trackside Fluid Engineers, Saifullah and Emil provide technical support and conduct chemical analysis of the fuel and lubricants used by the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team. They gather about 150 samples before and after every race, which they then analyse in the laboratory using three essential pieces of equipment: gas chromatograph, a viscometer, and a spectrometer. Gas chromatography shows the presence and composition of specific carbon substances, while the viscometer helps determine viscosity, and the spectrometer aids in identifying elemental composition.Toto and George at the PETRONAS Trackside Fluid Lab.The comprehensive analysis is important for the team to comply with the rules set by theFédération Internationale de l'Automobile(FIA), in addition to ensuring that the results are accurate which can contribute to the performance of the F1 racing car engine at an optimal level at each training session, qualification and race day.\"I",
