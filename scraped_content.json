In order to meet the energy needs of a growing global population while also minimizing climate change, TotalEnergies provides its customers with increasingly low-carbon products and services, thereby helping them to reduce their emissions and driving the energy transition.The key indicator of our progress is the lifecycle carbon intensity of the energy products sold, which is the ratio between the lifecycle emissions of our energy products sold and the quantity of energy supplied.Environment indicators (XLS)SummaryOffering our clients increasingly decarbonized energy productsProducing new low-carbon energyLeveraging our expertise to help our clients in their energy transitionReducing our indirect emissions: objectives and progress made in 2023Our transition in action: improving our products and supporting our customersReduction in the lifecycle carbon intensity of over17%in 2025 compared to 201525%in 2030 compared to 2015Scroll upScroll downOffering our clients increasingly decarbonized energy productsTotalEnergies has reaffirmed the relevance of its balanced integrated multi-energy strategy, anchored on two pillars, Oil & Gas, especially LNG, and electricity, the energy at the heart of the energy transition.By 2030, this strategy aims to result in a sales mix of energy products with the view to final use whose lifecyclecarbon intensityof energy products sold would be reduced by 25%, which means:for an equivalent quantity of energy, the carbon contentof energy products would be reduced by 25% over the lifecycle (“less emissions for same energy”), orfor an equivalent quantity of emissions over the lifecycle (Scope 1+2+3), the Company would supply 33% more energy to its customers (“more energy for same emissions”).We will grow in electricity production and sales, which will account for over 50% of the total reduction in carbon intensity by 2030. Indeed, we aim to reach 100 TWh/year of net electricity production by 2030.The reduction in carbon intensity will also be facilitated by the growth of gas sales, especially liquefied natural gas (LNG) – a transition fuel – so it will accounts for 50% of our energy mix by 2030.Moreover, we plan to bolster our range of products derived from biomass (biofuels, biogas, hydrogen and e-fuels), especially for sectors that are hard to electrify, such as air and sea transport, and heavy industry.To support this effort, we plan to allocate between $4 and $5 billion annually to low-carbon energies by 2030, including $4 billion in the Integrated Power sector.75%The proportion of low-carbon energies TotalEnergies is aiming to achieve in its sales energy mix by 2050We offer our clients increasingly decarbonized productsExpanding our electricity business, especially from renewable sources, through an integrated strategy from production to customersWe are building a portfolio of competitive, renewable (solar, onshore and offshore wind) and flexible (flexible gas-fired power plants, storage) assets in order to supply our customers with low-carbon electricity 24/7, in particular by signing renewable corporate power purchase agreements (CPPA).In 2024, the Company signed a renewable power purchase agreement with Saint-Gobain, under which TotalEnergies will supply renewable electricity to Saint-Gobain’s French facilities. It will take effect from January 2026 for a total volume of 875 GWh over a period of five years.Natural gas, a transition fuelGas is a necessary transition fuel for building a reliable, lower carbon power system, complementing renewable energies that are intermittent by nature. A flexible resource that can be mobilized quickly, power generation from gas-fired plants offers a secure backup for grids powered by intermittent renewable sources (such as solar and wind), which takes over when weather conditions are unfavorable or demand surges.Natural gas also provides a reliable alternative to many uses of coal, such as power generation or heat production for industry or retail customers, while emitting half as much CO2. That is why it occupies a central position in the Net Zero roadmaps of many coal consumer countries. To support these initiatives, TotalEnergies aims to increase the proportion of gas in its sa",

TotalEnergies is deploying a strategy that supports this collective transition and will enable our Company to adapt to the different scenarios that may materialize depending on developments in low-carbon technologies(adoption rate, cost reduction), geopolitical relations, international trade and consumer behavior.Climate indicators (XLS)SummaryDeveloping carbon capture and storage to reduce our emissions and those of our customersOffsetting residual emissions with nature-based carbon sinksScroll upScroll downDeveloping carbon capture and storage to reduce our emissions and those of our customersIn addition to our emission reduction projects and the initiatives carried out as part of our overall energy efficiency improvement program, we are developing Carbon Capture and Storage(CCS) to deal with a portion ofCO2emissions generated by our assets.CCS is an effective way to reduce the emissions from our plants, whether we are operator or partner, together with our other efforts in this area. In Norway, where we have joined forces with Equinor at the Snøhvit plant, around 9 Mt of CO2have been stored since 2008.Find out how we are developing carbon capture and storage (PDF)Scroll upScroll downOffsetting residual emissions with nature-based carbon sinksEcosystems, especially forests, are natural carbon sinks, which is why it is essential they are preserved if we are to achieve carbon neutrality.TotalEnergies prioritizes efforts first to reduce its direct emissions. The Company will begin voluntarily offsetting its residual Scope 1+2 emissions through NBS (Nature Based Solutions) only in 2030, gradually increasing up to 2050.We are investing in regenerative agriculture or wetland protection projects. Our approach involves combining and balancing the value of financial revenue from agriculture and forestry and the value of the benefits to soil, biodiversity, the water cycle and the production of carbon credits.An annual budget of approximately $100 million is allocated to these projects. We are working to build a high-quality portfolio, focusing closely on the integrity and lasting nature of the emissions reductions and sequestration achieved by the activities financed in this way.What are carbon credits?A carbon credit is a certificate for investing in projects that reduce, avoid, or remove a ton of CO2emissions or similar greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere. These certificates represent the market’s way of mitigating climate change. Carbon credits can be traded between public and private entities on mandatory markets (such as the carbon quota market) or voluntary markets, which may or may not be regulated.$100million/yearTotalEnergies’ annual investment in natural carbon sinksFind out how we are investing in natural carbon sinks (PDF)07/222025United States: TotalEnergies Expands Its Investments in Sustainable Forestry Operations to Preserve Carbon SinksFind out more08/302024United States: TotalEnergies Invests in Sustainable Forestry Operations to Preserve Sustainable Carbon SinksFind out moreNorthern Lights: A CO2Transport and Storage Project to Reduce Industrial Emissions in EuropeFind out moreTotalEnergies and CO2 capture and storageFind out more11/262024The Roads to Carbon Neutral- Season4- Episode8- Northern Lights: Storing CO2for a More Sustainable FutureFind out moreChapter 5.2.1 – “Climate change(E1)- Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model(ESRS2SBM-3)”Universal Registration Document 2024Further moreClimate and Sustainable EnergyLearn moreActing on our direct emissionsLearn moreImproving Our Products and Supporting Our CustomersLearn moreMore Energy, Less EmissionsSustainability & Climate 2025 Progress ReportMarch 2025Consult",

Once operational, the wind farm will generate around 6 TWh/year and supply low-carbon electricity to more than 1 million French households, a record.TotalEnergies will operate the project, drawing on its expertise in offshore wind power and the management of large offshore energy projects. The Company will continue the necessary studies in order to make the final investment decision, which is scheduled for early 2029. Electricity production is then expected to start in 2033, in line with RTE's connection schedule.The project is expected to represent an investment of around €4.5 billion, the largest made by TotalEnergies in France in 30 years.A promising project for the region and the industryAs with all its projects, the Company is actively committed to the economic development of the regions where it operates, with a vision of shared prosperity.TheCentre Manche2 project is expected to generate significant economic benefits for the Normandy region. Up to 2,500 people will be employed during the three years of construction, and TotalEnergies has committed to offering 500,000 hours of training to apprentices and people seeking to enter the workforce. In addition, the Company intends to support the local industrial fabric, which has already developed skills for the first offshore wind projects currently being installed.Finally, TotalEnergies has decided to implement a European preference policy for key equipment, particularly wind turbines and electrical cables.As a long-standing player in Normandy, we are determined to mobilize our expertise to ensure this project is an industrial success while securing its acceptance by the region. We will work to support the local industrial ecosystem, which has already developed skills through the first offshore wind projects currently being installed. Finally, this project strengthens our development in green electricity production to offer competitive prices to our French customers.Patrick PouyannéChairman and CEO of TotalEnergiesSustainable development and stakeholder engagementTotalEnergies is ensuring that the project is properly integrated into the Normandy region and maintaining ongoing consultation with local and regional stakeholders, which began during the tender phase. The challenges of coexistence with local players are significant, particularly with the professional fishing industry.In addition, the Company will set up a crowdfunding initiative that will enable residents and local authorities in the Normandy region to invest in the project and participate directly in the energy transition of their region.On the environmental side, €45 million will be devoted to measures to avoid, reduce and offset the project's impacts, and €15 million to a fund to promote biodiversity in Normandy.Finally, TotalEnergies is committed to recycling the components of the offshore wind farm. The recycling, reuse, or repurposing rates for blades, masts, and nacelles should be greater than or equal to 95%, and 100% of the generator magnets should be recycled or reused.TotalEnergies in FranceAll about our businesses in FranceLearn moreOur other projects and achievementsDiscover our major wind projectsDiscoverThe latest news from the Centre Manche 2 wind farm09/242025France: TotalEnergies Selected by the State as Operator of the Country’s Largest Renewable Energy ProjectPress release",

TotalEnergies is developing these new energies.BiofuelsToday, biofuels emit less than 50% more CO2e*than their fossil fuel equivalents over their life cycle, so they represent a way of decarbonizing liquid fuels. Demand is strong, making this a highly profitable market, but access to raw materials remains a barrier to growth.Among these biofuels, TotalEnergies favours the manufacture ofSustainable Aviation Fuel(SAF) to decarbonize the aviation sector, while the road sector has other options besides biodiesel to decarbonize, in particular electricity.To avoid land-use conflicts, TotalEnergies is developing solutionsbased on thepriority use of waste and residues from the food industry. As for the agricultural raw materials used, they comply with sustainability and traceability requirements: carbon footprint, non-deforestation, and good land use.TotalEnergies has set itself the target of increasing the proportion of circular feedstocks (waste oils, animal fats) to more than 50% of the feedstocks used to produce biofuels by 2025. The Company has also stopped sourcing palm oil.BiogasBiogas, produced by the degradation of organic waste, is a renewable gas composed mainly of methane. Compatible with existing gas transport and storage infrastructures, it has an important role to play in decarbonizing the use of gas products (power generation, heating).To this end, the Company is forging strategic partnerships with players in the agricultural, waste and wastewater treatment sectors to develop growth platforms in Europe and the United States.HydrogenTotalEnergies' priority is to decarbonize the hydrogen consumed in its European refineries by 2030, which should reduce CO2emissions by 3 Mt/year by 2030.Synthetic fuelsIn the future, using CO2as a raw material will help to decarbonize certain transport sub-sectors to an even greater extent. The captured CO2can be used, in reaction with green hydrogen, to produce fuels or synthesis gas.

As a pioneer in detecting and quantifying emissions in real-life conditions, TotalEnergies is using the AUSEA technology developed in cooperation with the French National Centre for Scientific Research(CNRS) and the University ofReims Champagne-Ardenne. It is one of the means we are using to reach our objective of near-zero methane emissions from our operations by2030.Methane is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28 times higher than that of CO2and a much shorter atmospheric lifetime. Reducing methane emissions is a priority, and TotalEnergies intends to establish an exemplary track record in this area.Since 2017, we have been working with the CNRS and the University ofReims Champagne-Ardenneto develop the AUSEA technology (Airborne Ultralight Spectrometer for Environmental Applications) to detect and quantify methane and carbon dioxide emissions.AUSEA: a solution for detecting and measuring emissionsThe AUSEA technology comprises a drone-mounted ultralight CO2and CH4sensor for ensuring access to hard-to-reach emission points while delivering readings with the highest precision. The sensor features a diode laser spectrometer and is capable of detecting and quantifying methane emissions with a high level of accuracy (> 1 kg/h).In 2022, a first campaign to detect and measure emissions on site in real-life conditions covered 95% of operated sites(1)in the upstream sector. More than 1,200 AUSEA flights were carried out in 8 countries to cover 125 sites.The long-term objective is to use the technology as part of a seamless and autonomous system. To achieve this aim, the research teams are looking to develop an unmanned drone navigation system with data automatically streamed to the servers, as well as instantaneous data processing and reporting capabilities. Automating the system will deliver immediate results to local operators at the facilities and increase the number of flights.In addition to detection campaigns at our operated sites, we are making AUSEA technology available to certain operators to enable them to carry out targeted detection campaigns on their own sites. This is a concrete action to encourage the entire sector, especially national companies, to move towards zero methane emissions.AUSEA: The Solution for Detecting and Measuring CO2and Methane EmissionsOur objective: near-zero methane emissions by2030Between 2010 and 2020, we halved our methane emissions by spearheading an action program targeting each of the emission sources at our assets (flaring, venting, fugitive emissions and incomplete combustion) and reinforcing the design criteria for our new facilities. To go even further, we are committed to a 50% reduction in our methane emissions by 2025 (achieved a year ahead of schedule) and 80% by 2030 compared to 2020 levels.These targets cover all our operated assets and go beyond the 75% reduction in methane emissions from coal, oil and gas between 2020 and 2030 outlined in the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario.(1) Calculated as a percentage of 100% operated production.Acting on our direct emissionsLearn moreOur other projects and achievementsDiscover our major innovation and R&D projectsDiscoverAll our news about AUSEA11/192024COP29: TotalEnergies and Oil India Join Forces to Collaborate on Methane Emissions Detection and MeasurementFind out more02/062024TotalEnergies and ONGC in India Join Forces to Detect and Measure Methane EmissionsFind out more12/182023TotalEnergies reiterates its long-term commitment to Nigeria and supports the country in reducing methane emissionsFind out more12/052023COP28: TotalEnergies Makes its Technology Available to three National Companies to Measure and Reduce Methane EmissionsFind out more05/162022Methane Emissions Reduction: TotalEnergies Implements a Worldwide Drone-Based Detection CampaignFind out more07/072021TotalEnergies and GHGSat Launch a New Initiative to Monitor Offshore Methane Emissions by SatelliteFind out mor",

Bioenergies are therefore a perfect fit with our ambition to become the responsible energy major. As a pioneer in biofuels for more than 20 years as well as a bioplastics producer, we have a role in the future of the bioenergies sector and the development of all biomass conversion pathways.Bioenergies:Helping to Reconcile Growth and Climate ChangeBiomass encompasses all organic material derived from plants, animals and microbes.Biomass can be converted to produce biofuels and bioplastics, and thereby help meet three major challenges.Meeting the energy needs of a growing world populationThe increase in global energy needs goes hand in hand with global population growth and economic and social development. In the transportation sector, energy needs are increasing by 31% per year. Demand for plastics is growing by 3% annually.Limiting global warmingAccording to the 2°C scenario put forward by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the world economy must undertake major changes in order to limit energy-related carbon emissions. One of the drivers identified to achieve this shift is an increase in the share of renewable energies, particularly through the development of biofuels.More than 20% of worldwide CO2emissions are attributable to transportation. Biofuels, which lower carbon dioxide emissions by at least 50% compared to fossil fuels, are key to reducing this sector’s environmental footprint. Today, biomass represents the only renewable alternative to fossil fuels in the production of liquid fuels, on which transportation still largely depends. A significant amount of legislation has been passed to encourage and channel the development of biofuels. In Europe, for example, 14% of transportation fuel must come from renewable sources by 2030.Also offering interesting prospects for reducing the environmental footprint is the development of bioplastics. Polylactic acid (PLA) polymers, for example, are biodegradable and less carbon-intensive than conventional polymers.Adapting to the changing expectations of customers and societyConscious of the urgency of combating climate change and sensitive to the issue of sustainable development, our customers are adapting their behavior and expect solutions with a lower environmental impact, including biofuels and bioplastics.Our ambition is to position TotalEnergies as a leader in biofuels by developing industrial and commercial expertise in biomass conversion. We are developing innovative bioplastics that will meet the challenges of sustainable development.Christophe VuillezSenior VP, Strategy, Development, Research at Refining & Chemicals, and head of the Biofuels divisionFind out the presentation by Bernard Pinatel, Director General Refining-Chemistry, on the mobility revolutionPreparing the Futureof Biofuels and BioplasticsTo achieve our ambition of becoming aleader in biofuelsanddeveloping innovative bioplastics, we are actively working on all biomass conversion solutions.We are involved in the two main biomass conversion pathways:Thermochemical conversion, which enables biomass to be transformed into a wide range of molecules through the combined action of pressure, temperature and often a catalyst.Biotechnology, which uses microorganisms, such as yeast, bacteria or microalgae that are capable of converting both plant matter and inorganic carbon (CO/CO2) into target molecules.These two pathways are flexible and can be used separately or together to produce a wide array of products from a variety of resources. However, many challenges still lie ahead.The bioproducts currently available on the market are mainly produced from vegetable oils and sugars. The conversion of resources such as lignocellulose (plant waste) or microalgae (microorganisms that can directly transform CO2and light into molecules of interest for our markets) is still in the R&D stage.TotalEnergies is presentacross the entire value chain, from R&D to industrial production.Developing our position as a producer and retailer of bioenergies through major industrial projectsAs a pioneer inbiofuels, for more than 20 years TotalEnergies has been producing ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), a gasoline additive, as well as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), which is used for diesel. We are also Europe’s leading retailer of biofuels, with more than 2.4 million metric tons incorporated into our gasoline and diesel in 2018, and we have developed in-depth knowledge of",

To tackle the climate challenge in a just and orderly manner, we must increase the pace of the energy transition while adapting to the specific needs of the various regions around the world. Expectations and challenges differ between OECD countries that are working to become carbon neutral by2050, and countries from the Global South for which access to energy is integral to their legitimate desire to improve their standard of living. TotalEnergies has adopted a strategy where it continues to supply the energy the world needs today, while accelerating the transition toward low-carbon energy in a responsible and sustainable way.As part of its approach towards carbon neutrality, our Company is mobilizing to reinvent energy, by activating two levers:reducing the emissions generated by its operated facilities, andinvesting in low-carbon energies and supporting its customers to change their habits.75%of low-carbon energy in our energy mix by 2050Climate indicators (XLS)Scroll upScroll downReducing our emissionsAll fossil energy producers must make reducing their direct emissions a top priority. That is why TotalEnergies has put in place an ambitious action plan to constantly reduce its direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1+2).The Company is committed to an approach towards carbon neutrality, together with society.To make this happen, we are taking action, in particular by stopping routine flaring, gradually eliminating methane emissions and improving energy efficiency.We are reducing our direct emissionsScroll upScroll downImproving our products and supporting our customersTotalEnergies helps to reduce the emissions generated by its customers’ energy use by investing heavily in developing renewable energy and natural gas – a transition fuel – while providing a comprehensive range of emission-reducing products and services.Because it is by providing more and more low-carbon products and services that we help transform the energy demand and enable our customers to cut their emissions.We track our progress on products and demand using the lifecycle carbon intensity, which is the ratio between the lifecycle emissions of our energy products sold (Scope 1+2+3) and the quantity of energy supplied (g CO2e/MJ).We are acting on the lifecycle carbon intensity of our energy mixScroll upScroll downOur approach towards carbon neutrality, together with societyThe energy transition requires the participation of all stakeholders, from regulators to end customers and industrial players. TotalEnergies is deploying a strategy that supports this collective transition and will enable our Company to adapt to the different scenarios that may materialize depending on developments in low-carbon technologies (adoption rate, cost reduction), geopolitical relations, international trade and consumer behavior.We develop CCS and offset residual emissions with nature-based carbon sinksOur climate and sustainable energy news01/302025Energy Outlook 2024: TotalEnergies Sets Out Its Vision for Energy Transition by 2050Find out more12/052024Decarbonization of the Oil & Gas Sector: TotalEnergies Steps up Its CommitmentFind out more01/092024TotalEnergies Ranked As The World’s Leading Solar Developer In 2023Find out more01/032024Energy Outlook 2023: Our Insights Into the Energy Transition in 2050Find out moreChapter 5.2.1 – “Climate change(E1)- Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model(ESRS2SBM-3)”Universal Registration Document 2024Sustainability & Climate 2025 Progress ReportAccess the reportTotalEnergiesEnergy Outlook2025Read the TEOAll our ESG documentsVisit",

At TotalEnergies, we pursue this goal with steadfast determination. Across our operated facilities(Scope1+2), we aim to achieve carbon neutrality by2050, with an intermediate target to reduce our net greenhouse gas emissions by40% by2030, compared with2015levels. This target is consistent with the roadmap set out in the European Union’s “Fit-for-55” package and the IEA’s 2024 NetZeroEmission scenario.To make this happen, we are deploying cutting-edge technology to improve energy efficiency across our sites, gradually eliminate methane emissions, stop routine flaring and decarbonize our facilities.Climate indicators (XLS)SummaryImproving the energy efficiency of our sitesAiming for zero methane emissions by 2030Eliminating routine flaring by 2030Decarbonizing our operated sites through low-carbon electricity supply and electrificationBuilding low-carbon hydrogen supply for our refineries in Europe by 2030Reducing our direct emissions (Scope 1+2): objectives and progress made in 2024Our transition in action: reducing our direct emissions40%Reduction across our net emissions from operated facilities by 2030, compared with 2015 levelsScroll upScroll downImproving the energy efficiency of our sitesGenerating energy savings in our operations is beneficial in several ways: we contribute to the collective campaign for energy efficiency, we help to reduce our carbon emissions and we lower our costs.In September 2022, TotalEnergies launched a plan to accelerate energy efficiency improvements at its sites worldwide. Over the period 2023-2025, we are investing $1 billion to reduce our energy consumption and cut emissions by 2 Mt CO2e.Taking into account the efficiency projects reported by the teams at the industrial sites, a second energy efficiency improvement plan will be rolled out over the period 2026-2028, for a total of $1 billion.2Mt CO2eReduction of our emissions by 2025Enhancing energy efficiency at our facilities (PDF)Scroll upScroll downAiming for zero methane emissions by 2030Methane is a greenhouse gas with28times(1)greater global warming potential thanCO2over a100-year timescale, making it key to any emission reduction strategy. The oil and gas industry, responsible for a considerable proportion of global methane emissions, must lead the way.As a driving force in the energy transition, TotalEnergies is fully assuming its leadership role in the fight to collectively reduce methane emissions and has been striving for many years to reduce them. As a result, we successfully halved the volume of methane emissions generated by our operated facilities between 2010 and 2020. Moreover, we aim to cut these emissions by a further 60% by 2025 and 80% by 2030 compared with 2020 levels. These objectives apply to all Company operations and go beyond the 75% reduction in methane emissions from coal, oil and gas between 2020 and 2030 outlined in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario published by the International Energy Agency.In addition, we are bringing our partners at our non-operated facilities on board by sharing feedback and best practices, for example with theOil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0). More generally, we are working with our partners at all our non-operated facilities to encourage them to reduce direct emissions. In our Exploration & Production business segment, we have created a team responsible for sharing a decarbonization roadmap that usually includes an energy assessment, energy efficiency improvements, the elimination of methane venting and routine flaring.80%Reduction of our methane emissions from operated facilities by 2030, compared with 2020 levelsFind out how we are reducing our methane emissions (PDF)Eliminating routine flaring by 2030It is essential to put an end to routine flaring in order to reduce our CO2and methane emissions: we pledged to stop this practice on new projects back in2000.As a founding member of the Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative launched in 2014 by the World Bank, we are committed to ending routine flaring by 2030.Since 2010, we have cut the volume of gas routinely flared by 90% across our operated facilities. We aim to fall below 0.1 Mm3/day by 2025, before eliminating routine flaring altogether by 2030.0Mm3/dayOur routine flaring emissions target for 2030What is routine flaring?(2)R",

We buy and sell this oil and gas around the world. Our teams work to maximize the value of our products, secure supply to our refineries and transport energy to consumer hubs, all while managing the related financial and logistical risks. We are active in 120 countries where we deal with all aspects of oil and gas trading, including physical trading, derivatives and shipping.An integrated energy operator with a global networkMarketing oil and gas all over the world at the right price means managing two important variables:Financial markets and price risks linked to market volatility, which depend on a number of economic, geopolitical and even climate-related factors.Arranging shipping from production areas to consumer hubs worldwide under optimal safety conditions and in a timely, cost-effective way.To rise to these challenges, our trading & shipping teams around the world work in close collaboration with TotalEnergies' Upstream and Downstream business segments, forming aone-stop shopon oil and gas markets. This optimizes transactions and means that we are equipped to offertailored solutionsto a wide range of players, from producers, transporters and refiners to financial institutions and industrial firms.We trade with anextensive global network of partners every day, affording usa highly diversified range of resources and supply sources to complement our production volumes. This maximizes the chances of selling both our own and our partner producers’ production while securing supply flows to our refineries and our distribution system.TotalEnergies' trading and shipping operationsTrading:maximizing the value of our own and our customers’ assetsEvery day, our traders deal in oil and gas markets. Their mission is to maximize the value of our production, supply our refineries under the best market conditions and import and export products to match supply to demand in local markets. In addition, they are tasked with managing risks, in particular to limit our exposure to sometimes extreme price fluctuations.Thanks to our expertise and experience in oil markets, we have developed monitoring and decision-support tools at the cutting-edge of trading. Our teams enjoy a global view of real-time flows and segment information, around the clock. As a result, we can respond to developments with the agility needed to maximize the value of our own assets and those of our customers.“We are pioneers in trading liquefied natural gas (LNG)”Long controlled by State-owned companies, the European gas industry was largely privatized during the 2000s. This development paved the way for the creation of a free market for LNG trading. TotalEnergies was one of the first companies to have seized the opportunities presented by this emerging market, with our first transactions taking place in 2003. Today, we are among the top three companies in the market.In line with our strategy, we work to anticipate the launch of new liquefaction projects and to maximize the value of our LNG portfolio in every market.LNG trading relies on a very broad range of skills, including arbitrage, one of our longstanding areas of expertise. The purpose of arbitrage is to redirect shipments in response to opportunities created by local demand and prices while managing shipping, price, currency and interest rate risk.Shipping:transporting oil and gasWe organize the transportation of oil and gas from production areas to major consumer hubs. We select and charter the safest vessels to ensure that cargo is shipped in the most timely, cost-effective way and, naturally, under optimal safety conditions.Leveraging a leading maritime transportation networkIn 2021, we chartered nearly 2,700 vessels to transport 120 million metric tons of crude oil and petroleum products. We maintain a permanent fleet of nearly 47 time-chartered vessels. We apply one of the most rigorous selection standards in the oil industry for every ship we use, especially those in our fleet. To make sure each vessel meets our standards, our vetting process notably evaluates the condition of the equipment, ship maintenance, crew quality and operating procedures on board.In 2021, we sold more than 42 million metric tons of LNG. We transported this gas on board ultra-high-performance LNG carriers capable of maintaining an extreme cold chain (-163°C) between the liquefaction site and the regasification plant.Ice-Class LNG Carriers: Opening Up a Wh",

Atlantis, one of bp’s longest-running platforms in the Gulf of America, has a gross production capacity of up to 200,000 barrels of oil per day.The Atlantis Drill Center 1 expansion adds two wells to an existing drill center, a subsea hub connecting multiple wells. The subsea tieback, which connects new wells to existing offshore production facilities through pipelines, extends the footprint of the Atlantis field discovered in 1998.“Atlantis Drill Center 1 caps off an excellent year of seven major project start-ups for bp. This project supports our plans to safely grow our upstream business, which includes increasing US production to around 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030.”Gordon Birrell, EVP, production & operationsbp delivered the Atlantis Drill Center 1 expansion project two months ahead of its original schedule by utilizing existing subsea inventory, drilling and completing wells more efficiently, and streamlining offshore execution planning. This is bp’s fifth major startup that has been delivered ahead of schedule this year.\"Atlantis Drill Center 1 caps off an excellent year of seven major project start-ups for bp. This project supports our plans to safely grow our upstream business, which includes increasing US production to around 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030.“This latest success demonstrates the dedication of our US project team and our teams around the world, who are delivering new barrels at pace and with lower production costs, in service of growing long-term value for shareholders,\" said Gordon Birrell, bp’s executive vice president of production and operations.The Atlantis Drill Center 1 expansion is the second in a series of new projects bp is planning in the US Gulf of America between now and the end of the decade that are expected to enable bp to boost its capacity to produce more than 400,000 boe/d from the US offshore region by 2030.In August 2025, bp started up theArgos Southwest Extension project, a three-well subsea tieback that is adding 20,000 boe/d barrels a day of gross peak annualized average oil production to our Argos platform. In 2027, bp plans to deliver Atlantis Major Facility Expansion, which will further increase production from the Atlantis field using existing infrastructure.“This expansion at Atlantis is further testament to the benefits of maximizing production from our existing platforms in the Gulf of America, growing bp’s US offshore energy production safely and efficiently.“We are committed to investing in America as we firmly believe this region will continue to play a critical role in delivering secure and reliable energy to the world today and tomorrow,” said Andy Krieger, bp’s senior vice president for the Gulf of America and Canada.In addition to the Atlantis Drill Center 1 expansion project, bp started up major projects this year in Trinidad and Tobago (2), the UK North Sea, Egypt, Mauritania and Senegal, as well as Argos Southwest Expansion in the Gulf of America – contributing to its plan to deliv",

These tools are helping us deliver some of our best-ever performance numbers for asset reliability and availability, while also helping us explore and produce oil and gas, and serve our customers.Take a look at five ways that technology is helping to power our performance.Increased productionAI and technology have helped to lift our upstream plant reliability to nearly 97% in thethird quarter 2025. It’s helping us anticipate issues before they turn into problems so we can keep our plants up and running.Between 2022 and 2024, we increased production from assets we operate ourselves by around 4% and protected around 10% more from going offline through surveillance and real-time monitoring and analysis.Next-level imagingSeismic imaging has always been a cornerstone of oil and gas exploration, but recent advances are helping us explore more accurately and successfully, as well as track changes tofields over time. This contributed to one of our best recorded years for exploration with 12 new discoveries, including through our joint ventures.We can now get a clearer picture ofwhat’s below the surfacewith the help of powerful computing and AI. We are quadrupling the capacity of our high-performance computing centre, allowing us to increase the speed at which we can process information by about 5 to 10 times, enabling higher resolution results.“bp continues to stand out through our world-class petro-technical expertise and cutting-edge technology, reinforcing our role as a trusted partner of choice for safe, efficient and reliable performance,” says Ariel Flores, SVP subsurface.“bp continues to stand out through our world-class petro-technical expertise and cutting-edge technology, reinforcing our role as a trusted partner of choice for safe, efficient and reliable performance”Ariel Flores,SVP, subsurfaceHours savedThere are many potential paths that can be drilled to access oil and gas under the ground. Technology is helping to make these decisions easier and faster. It used to take weeks or months to identify and plan the best route from the surface to the reservoir.Our digital tools, like the asset and wells trajectory optimizer (AWTO), have helped safely cut this time to days.AWTO has been used to plan well paths in the Gulf of America and Egypt, and a newly developed high-performance computing enabled web app is currently in use in the North Sea and Azerbaijan in preparation for wider deployment in 2026.Safer drillingData analytics is helping us identify patterns that may indicate when equipment might need maintenance, supporting reliability and helping to keep our people safer.That includes drilling “kicks” – sudden changes in pressure and flow inside wells. We’re now getting about 90% detection , which means safer, faster responses, fewer surprises and less downtime in our wells.“Right now, data analytics, automation and AI are already working wonders in our wells business and right across the upstream at bp,” says Ann Davies, SVP wells.Smarter stockingIn retail, we’re piloting smart technology to make our stores more efficient and improve experiences for customers and colleagues. From self-service checkouts to retail crime intelligence platforms, we are taking action to deliver improvements.In the UK, an AI-enabled stock replenishment system is helping us predict demand across 320",

(NYSE: CTVA) and bp (NYSE: BP, LSE: BP.L) today announced the launch of Etlas, their new 50:50 joint venture that will produce oil from crops – including canola, mustard and sunflower – for use in the production of biofuels like sustainable (or synthetic) aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (RD). Etlas will harness both Corteva’s century-long expertise in seed technology to develop crops ideally suited to produce SAF and RD as well as bp’s expertise in refining and marketing fuel for the commercial transportation market.Etlas aims to produce one million metric tonnes of feedstock per year by the mid-2030s, which could produce over 800 thousand tonnes of biofuel. Initial supply is scheduled to begin in 2027 for use in co-processing at refineries as well as at dedicated biofuels plants.Leading industry estimates have global demand for SAF growing to as much as 10 million tonnes by 20301-- from about 1 million tonnes in 2024, while global demand for RD could rise to as much as 35 million tonnes by 20302from approximately 17 million tonnes in 2024. Etlas is designed to provide a reliable, scalable supply of feedstock to help meet this expected demand.“We’re excited to collaborate with Corteva to deliver what our customers want”Philipp Schoelzel, senior vice president, biofuels growthThe feedstock Etlas uses will be harvested from crops that are grown on existing cropland, between main food cropping seasons. Such intermediate crops can help improve soil health while providing farmers with a new revenue stream. As they use existing cropland during times when it has previously been unproductive like a fallow or cover period, they also do not lead to additional demand for land.Judd O’Connor, executive vice president of Corteva’s seed business unit added: “By helping found Etlas, Corteva continues to deliver on two critical parts of our mission: to help fuel the world and to support farmers. Agriculture is part of the solution, and we are excited to see Etlas come to life.”Philipp Schoelzel, senior vice president, biofuels growth, bp added: “This capital light joint venture creates optionality in our biofuels value chain, strengthening our position and helping deliver attractive returns. We’re excited to collaborate with Corteva to deliver what our customers want.\"Ignacio Conti, Global Business Development Director at Corteva will be the new Etlas Chief Executive Officer and Gaurav Sonar, vice president, Novel Feedstocks at bp will become its Chair of the Board of Directors.“As the aviation industry looks for reliable, sustainable and cost-competitive sources of SAF, it is clear farmers have a critical role to play,” said Etlas CEO, Ignacio Conti. “Etlas brings together global leaders in agriculture innovation and energy production to harness this demand by leveraging technological expertise and trusted relationships with farmers around the world to help scale production and boost supply while offering farmers new revenue streams.”Footnotes:1Financing Sustainable Aviation Fuels: Case Studies and Implications for Investment | World Economic Forum2IEA Renewable Energy Progress Tracker – Accelerated Scenario(42.7 billion litres converted to tonnes)About CortevaCorteva, Inc.

And their efforts are paying off, with Chevron now producing 1 million barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE) per day in the Permian Basin.“We’re literally helping power America,” Colburn said. “I’m proud to play a part in it.”“Americans count on us to keep production running.”Curt ColburnProduction SupervisorHands at workIn Colorado, people like Nick Gonzalez are hard at work overseeing Chevron’s operations in an area that produces approximately 400,000 BOE per day.Gonzalez is responsible for managing the Colorado region’s integrated operations center, where Chevron uses digital tools and systems to optimize performance.“I’m blessed to work with a team that takes pride in and is passionate about safely and responsibly providing energy to our community,” Gonzalez said. “We understand the need for responsible operations and take that seriously.”“Powering America takes all of us. When we work together, we build something bigger.”Nick GonzalezIntegrated Operations Center SupervisorChevron is the largest oil and gas producer in Colorado, and the company’s employees work tirelessly to monitor its 24-hour operations so that it can safely deliver affordable and reliable energy.“I’m consistently impressed with the talent and dedication within this company,” Gonzalez said. “Some of the best and brightest are working to solve the problems that the industry faces.”Chevron Colorado alsoleverages technology and innovationto reduce its operational footprint and its carbon intensity.For example, Chevron Colorado’s next-generation tankless facilities reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 90% in 2024 and reduced surface footprint by more than 95%, compared with legacy designs.Oil and natural gas production supports 10.8 million jobs in all 50 states and contributes nearly $1.8 trillion to the U.S. economy (according to a 2021 report prepared for the American Petroleum Institute).Powering progressBehind America’s energy leadership stands the workforce that drives its success. With help from employees like Colburn and Gonzalez, Chevron boosted its U.S. production by nearly 20% in 2024, bringing more energy to the communities and businesses that keep America running.Investments with impactChevron supports the communities where it operates, spending $44 billion with U.S. vendors and suppliers since 2022.In 2026, the company plans to spend about $10.5 billion on U.S. energy projects, creating jobs and stimulating industrial growth. In the Permian Basin, where Chevron has maintained a presence for more than a century, its operations have contributed to a flourishing regional economy that supported approximately 630,000 jobs in Texas and 145,000 in New Mexico in 2023.The company supported more than 850,000 jobs nationwide that year.The investments Chevron is making are helping drive U.S. energy security and the U.S. energy advantage.“It takes real investment to help keep this country running.

Every day, employees are finding creative solutions to problems, some drawing on skills gained and lessons learned in the military.Meet Adam Ersepke, Jeremy Lenart, John Kolichis and Cody Winberg, four of the Chevron employees who have put knowledge and experience gained during their military service around the world into action for Chevron.jeremy lenart: a love of helicopters helps drone program take flightWhen Jeremy Lenart isn’t golfing, fishing or hunting with his daughters in southeast Louisiana, he’s got his eye on helicopters and drones. The former U.S. Marine sergeant is an aircraft mechanic with Chevron in theGulf of America, where he works on helicopters—and lives out a childhood dream.“There are two things I’ve always wanted to be,” said Lenart, “a Marine and a helicopter mechanic. So I did both.”“The Marines teach you to look outside the box and drive toward adapting something into something much more.”jeremy lenartaviation fuel specialistLenart still incorporates the lessons he learned as a Marine into his daily work in the Gulf—particularly lessons about discipline, integrity and attention to detail.“Working on aircraft takes a lot of those. You can’t cut corners, because people’s lives are at stake,” he said.Lenart is now a certified drone pilot in the Gulf. And he was tapped to help launch Chevron’s drone program, which uses drones for aerial inspections. Using drones saves personnel hours and reduces human exposure to high-risk offshore environments, such as heights or scaffolding. Lenart also has used drones to create 3D models of offshore resources as reference materials for Chevron engineers.Not surprisingly, Lenart’s work with drones pairs well with his work on Chevron’s helicopters. “We’re also using drones to take aerial footage for our operations team or for pilots to know what type of vessel they’re landing on,” he explained.adam ersepke: problem-solving skills lead to AI innovationsAdam Ersepke’s former job as an infantry rifleman in the U.S. Marine Corps is very different from his current job as a senior performance engineer at Chevron. But there are some essential skills he learned as a Marine that carry over to innovating in Chevron’sshale and tight business.“The biggest is being able to come up with new ways to solve problems under pressure,” he said. “And when these problems evolve and there’s no clear-cut solution, you have to leverage the people around you to help solve them.”“The military builds good problem solvers, and I like Chevron’s problem-solving culture.”adam ersepkesenior performance drilling engineer specialistOne problem Ersepke encountered in thePermian Basininvolved considerable amounts of data coming in from Chevron’s wells and wells the company co-owns with other businesses in the region. Chevron has a revenue interest in one of every five wells in the region, so there’s a lot of data available. The information itself represents an opportunity to learn more about well performance. But data used to arrive in formats that were difficult to manage or even sift through.Ersepke and his team helped create two AI-powered tools to make data-managing easier. “Now, engineers get a summary of daily activity data and trends,” he explained. “And AI can extract key data from drilling reports. The data displays in a filterable way for engineers to conduct analysis from nearby wells.”Having this kind of information on hand is a big help to engineers because, in Ersepke’s words, “it allows engineers to focus on actual engineering rather than data mining.”john kolichis: culture can translate to operational excellenceJohn Kolichis has served in Australia’s Army Reserves for more than 20 years. When not in uniform, he works atWheatstone—the country’s first liquefied natural gas (LNG) hub. Wheatstone, together with fellow LNG project Gorgon, supplies nearly half of Western Australia’s domestic gas, helping power homes and industries.The economic ripple effect of Wheatstone’s impact goes beyond energy. It has created local jobs and awarded more than 300 contracts to Australian businesses. “Knowing how important what we do is for our state services and economy adds some pressure,” said Kolichis. “But it’s also very rewarding and provides a",

In his spare time, he volunteers as a math tutor, and every year since 2019, he has also volunteered at the annual New Mexico Governor’s STEM Challenge.This annual competition invites high school students to present a STEM-based solution to a pressing issue facing a local community, a region or the world. The contest was created jointly by the governor’s office, the state’s departments of education and workforce solutions, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and 18 STEM employers. Led by the governor’s office, the event aims to connect STEM students with local STEM companies. Bush is among the Questa-based Chevron employees who mentor a team of students from a New Mexico high school as they compete in the challenge.“It gives you hope for the future,” Bush said when asked why he enjoys volunteering with the STEM Challenge.investing in STEM in new mexicoChevron’s role as a host sponsor of New Mexico’s STEM Challenge is one part of the company’s larger effort to champion STEM education in the state.From 2016 to 2024, Chevron invested more than $4 million in education programs and initiatives throughout New Mexico. The company has supported in-school programs for kids, training programs for instructors, higher education programs and more.“The goal of pursuing STEM programs is to show students the amazing opportunities out there that they might not learn about in their regular school day,” said Melissa Abel, a Chevron corporate affairs advisor.$4 million+invested in education programs (K-12) from 2016 to 2024120+local organizations supported by Chevron from 2016 to 2024$8 million+invested in New Mexico communities from 2016 to 2024forming partnerships to encourage educationInvesting in STEM education also helps addressbrain drainin New Mexico. This term describes what happens when highly educated and skilled professionals, like STEM workers, leave an area for better opportunities.Chevron works with the Permian Strategic Partnership (PSP) in the state to combat this and build a STEM workforce. “We want to grow a pipeline,” Abel said. “But Chevron can’t do it on our own. That’s why collaboration is key.” The PSP comprises 26 energy companies and two academic institutions working to address challenges related to workplace shortages by investing in education and workforce development.creating pathways to higher education in new mexicoThe oil and gas sector makes up approximately 25% to 30% of the state’s revenue. This economic contribution helps allow New Mexico to offer high school students and adults returning to college free tuition through its Higher Education Trust Fund. The trust fund was started last year with nearly $1 billion from oil and gas proceeds going to support programs like the Opportunity Scholarship, which helped more than 34,000 New Mexicans in the spring 2025 semester.Bush sees the importance of STEM in his own family. “I have two daughters with STEM jobs. My oldest daughter is a botanist who works for one of Chevron’s contractors. The other is a nurse. So I personally try and encourage more young women to get into the field,” he explained.And he learned from a chance encounter at a recent Governor’s STEM Challenge event that his mission, and Chevron’s support, is having an impact in his community. “I was talking to a parent, and she said, ‘There was somebody here from Chevron last year who really supported having women in STEM, and it helped me get my daughter encouraged to try STEM.’ Well, that was me,” he recalled with a laugh.learn more about chevron’s work in new mexicopartnership aims to conserve pecos riverread articlesolar energy field takes shaperead articlenew mexico state fair reflects rich historyread articledonations aid victims of new mexico firesread articletopics coveredpeople and communityrelated contentThe people who power the US energy advantageour operationsjanuary 14, 2026frontline innovations drive business solutionspeople and communitynovember 12, 2025greeley stampede is riding high, with chevron’s supportpeople and communityaugust 18, 2025supporting conservation in new mexicopeople and communitymay 27, 2025view archivechevron email updatesSubscribe to our newsletter to recei",

Ballymore, the latest in a series of Chevron projects to start up in the past year, represents another step towards the company’s goal to produce 300,000 net barrels per day of oil equivalent from the Gulf in 2026. Ballymore is expected to produce up to 75,000 gross barrels of oil per day through three wells tied back three miles to the existing Chevron-operated Blind Faith facility.“Ballymore is an example of how we are leveraging technology and driving efficiencies to help produce affordable, reliable energy from the deepwater Gulf of America, one of the lowest carbon intensity oil and gas producing basins in the world,” said Brent Gros, vice president, Chevron Gulf of America. “Ballymore, which was completed on time and on budget, brings additional production online without building a new standalone offshore platform. This reduces our development costs and is expected to drive higher returns for shareholders.”Chevron is a leading leaseholder in the Gulf and continues to actively pursue opportunities for growth in the basin. Since midyear 2024, Chevron has started production from its industry-first Anchor project and non-operated Whale project and commenced water injection to boost output at its operated Tahiti and Jack/St. Malo facilities.Estimated potentially recoverable resources at Ballymore are 150 million barrels of oil equivalent gross over the life of the project. Ballymore is located in the Mississippi Canyon area in around 6,600 feet (2,000 m) of water, about 160 miles (260 km) southeast of New Orleans. The development is Chevron’s first in the Norphlet trend of the Gulf.Chevron subsidiary Chevron U.S.A. Inc. is operator of the Ballymore project with 60 percent working interest. Co-owner TotalEnergies E&P USA, Inc. has 40 percent working interest.About ChevronChevron is one of the world’s leading integrated energy companies.
